# Good Python, Guy!

Good Python, Guy! is a web front-end for GPG. It does not offer complete GPG functionality. What it does is provide a simple and easy way to send encrypted mail to a recipient. The user is required to have three things: the recipients e-mail, the recipients public key, and a message they wish to send to the recipient. The goal is to allow anyone with access to a web-browser to be able to send encrypted mail without the need to install and configure GPG.

The source-code for our webapp is freely available here. You are free to use, modify, and distribute it however you want. We do ask that you give credit to us though (but we can't and won't force you to).

We're using the Python Flask microframework for our backend, Ember.js and Bootstrap for the frontend, and we're powering everything on a Linode server.
